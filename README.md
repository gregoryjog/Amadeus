### This is a demo LLM chat frontend with a focus on DnD and tabletop games. It is a work in progress.

### The frontend itself uses Flask, utlizing Sqlite to store the chat history. The history and sessions themselves are uploaded to Zep and embedded for recall. 

### Additionally, a Qdrant vector store is initialized separately to hold all lore, world, and character sheet information provided by the user.
